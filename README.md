# LeagueToxicity

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lyubent/LeagueToxicity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lyubent/LeagueToxicity)

#### A small Spark project based around the League of Legends API. This is just for fun and to see some of the latest and greatest features of Spark 2.


### Initial Ideas:

- Build a service to collect game data.
- Use the publicly available [static dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/riot-api/seed_data/matches1.json ) for initial analysis on the match making system and its fairness.
- Fetch 10000 match-made game results using public Riot API.
